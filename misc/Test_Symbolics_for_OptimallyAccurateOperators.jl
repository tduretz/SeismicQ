# Sorry for the "bordel", Boris.
# The bunch of exercises (Wave_Day2_clean_super, Operators.jl, pascalTriangle, testOperators)
# are the contribution from Kensuke Wesly Inst. Konishi and me myself. 
# We are trying to seek high-oder operators for 1D,2D,3D differentiation adapted to FSG scheme here
# and apply a Geller-Takeuchi (1995,1998) scheme to find optimally accurate operators boundary
# evaluating the errors of mass matrix (acceleration term) and stiffness matrix (all the viso-elasto-whatever)
#
# Titi told me that I should learn how to code with Symbolics so let's go (it's 16h on Friday though)
